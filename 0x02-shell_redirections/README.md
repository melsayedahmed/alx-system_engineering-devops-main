8. [Save current state of directory](./8-cwd_state) : A script that writes into the file `ls_cwd_content` the result of the command `ls -la`. If the file `ls_cwd_content` already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file `ls_cwd_content`does not exist, create it.

    - The current and present directories should not be taken into account.
    - Hidden directories should be counted.
      - **Solution:** `mindepth 1` ; To exclude root directory

    - The output should be; one file per line and sorted from the newest to the oldest.

    - Input and Output format is; `One word per line`.
    - Words should be sorted. (use this [list](./list) as your input to see if the challenge will work. ðŸ˜Š) `cat list | ./13-unique`
14. [It must be in that file](./14-findthatword) : A script that prints lines containing the pattern `"root"` from the file `/etc/passwd`.
15. [Count that word](./15-countthatword) : A script that displays the number of lines that contain the pattern `"bin"` in the file `/etc/passwd`.

23. [Empty casks make the most noise](./100-empty_casks) : A script that finds all empty files and directories in the current directory and all sub-directories.
    - Only names of the files and directories should be displayed (not the entire path.)
    - Hidden files should be listed also, one file name per line and the listing should end with a new line.

    - One file name per line. 
    - The listing should end with a new line.

The word comes from the French acrostiche from post-classical Latin acrostichis). As a form of constrained writing, an acrostic can be used as a mnemonic device to aid memory retrieval.` [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic)

    - Order by number of requests, most active host or IP at the top.
    - You are not allowed to use `grep`, `egrep`, `fgrep` or `rgrep`.
